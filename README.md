There are just two key updates—so if you're happy with your current setup, no pressure to upgrade:
1. 	Auto-rollover to the next day: If you leave the program open overnight, it now advances the calendar automatically.
2. 	Syringe graphic overhaul: Finally! It’s now correctly oriented and animated—fills up when you hit Calculate, empties when you hit Log Injection.
Unless any major bugs pop up, this will be the last update for a while as I shift gears for work and the holiday season.
Thanks again for all the support—I truly hope the tracker’s been helpful.
Note: Still Windows-only for now.
